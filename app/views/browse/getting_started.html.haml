    %p.padded After you've signed up for Liberatio on the Website, you can begin by either adding devices of any type or system manually (called Unmanaged Devices), or by installing the Agent (called Managed Devices) on devices to have them inventoried, and to enable additional functionality such as Remote Commands, etc.
